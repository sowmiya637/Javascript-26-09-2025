# Student Marks Summary - Loops Example

This web page demonstrates the use of various JavaScript loops (`for`, `while`, `do...while`, `for...in`, and `for...of`) to process and display student marks data. It also shows how to apply control flow statements like `continue` and `break` within loops.

- Lists students and their marks using a `for...in` loop.
- Calculates total and average marks for each student using a combination of `for` and `while` loops.
- Displays students who scored above 80 in the first exam using a `do...while` loop.
- Finds and lists students with an average below 70 using a `for...of` loop and `continue`.
- Stops listing students after finding the first two below-average students using `break`.
- Uses styled output with dynamic HTML spans for better readability.


## How It Works

1. **Student Data:** An object contains student names as keys and arrays of their marks as values.
2. **Displaying Marks:** Uses a `for...in` loop to iterate over student names and list their marks.
3. **Total & Average Calculation:** Calculates total and average marks for each student using a `while` loop inside a `for...in` loop.
4. **High Scores:** Uses a `do...while` loop to list students scoring above 80 in their first exam.
5. **Below Average Students:** Uses `for...of` and `continue` to list students with an average below 70.
6. **Limiting Output:** Uses `break` to stop the listing after showing the first two below-average students.
7. **Styling:** Wraps outputs in HTML `<span>` tags with CSS classes to visually differentiate sections and highlight important data.
